# Final Project :- Machine learning

## Introduction

This repository showcases my final project in machine learning, where I have worked on three different datasets to build predictive models and analyze various aspects of the data. The three datasets used in this project are:

1. **Car_data** of CarDekho.com from Kaggle
2. **Wine** from Guvi 
3. **Zomato** from Guvi 

For each dataset, I have conducted thorough data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to make accurate predictions. Below, I provide a brief overview of each dataset and highlight key achievements in this project.
